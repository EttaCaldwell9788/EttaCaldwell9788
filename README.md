## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a cloud engineer leveraging the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to manage infrastructure as code (IaC) with precision, scalability, and efficiency. This repository showcases how I use AWS CDK to automate resource provisioning, enforce best practices, and implement cost-effective cloud architectures.

AWS CDK allows developers to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Java. By using CDK, I build reusable, testable, and version-controlled stacks that streamline the deployment of complex cloud environments.

Automated Resource Provisioning: The projects in this repository demonstrate how to declaratively create and manage AWS resources such as VPCs, ECS clusters, Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and RDS instances. I use constructs and stacks to enforce consistency across environments and simplify infrastructure rollouts with minimal manual intervention.

Cloud Cost Optimization: Keeping cloud expenses under control is a key objective in all deployments. I incorporate strategies such as auto-scaling, right-sizing compute instances, leveraging spot instances, and lifecycle policies for storage. Youâ€™ll find examples that show how infrastructure can be both scalable and cost-efficient without sacrificing performance.

Each project includes CI/CD integration using AWS CodePipeline or GitHub Actions to automate deployments and apply changes safely and reliably. Additionally, I use tagging, monitoring, and security configurations as part of the CDK codebase to ensure traceability and compliance.

This repository is ideal for DevOps engineers, cloud architects, and developers looking to adopt modern infrastructure practices on AWS. Whether you're managing a single app or a multi-environment platform, these examples are designed to help you build smarter with IaC.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”cloud automation begins with clean, maintainable infrastructure code.
